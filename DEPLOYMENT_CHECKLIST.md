## ⚙️ Configuration

### ✅ Database Setup
- [ ] D1 database created: `wrangler d1 create your-contact-db`
- [ ] Database ID copied from output
- [ ] Schema applied locally: `wrangler d1 execute your-contact-db --file=schema.sql`

### ✅ 🔐 Secure Configuration Setup
- [ ] **SECURITY CHECK:** Verified `.gitignore` includes production config files
- [ ] Template files copied securely:
  - [ ] `cp wrangler.example.jsonc wrangler.jsonc`
  - [ ] `cp .env.example .env`
- [ ] **SECURITY CHECK:** Confirmed `wrangler.jsonc` and `.env` are NOT tracked by git
- [ ] Worker name updated (no spaces, hyphens/underscores only)
- [ ] Account ID updated (from `wrangler whoami`)
- [ ] Database name and ID updated
- [ ] FROM_EMAIL updated (must be on your Cloudflare domain)
- [ ] ADMIN_EMAIL updated (must be verified in Email Routing)
- [ ] `allowed_destination_addresses` updated with verified emails
- [ ] **SECURITY CHECK:** No production credentials in any committed files

### ✅ Application Configuration
- [ ] `src/config.ts` updated with your company information
- [ ] Company name changed from "Your Company Name"
- [ ] Service types customized for your business
- [ ] Admin email addresses updated (if not using Cloudflare Access)
- [ ] Branding/colors customized (optional)

## 🔐 Security Configuration

### ✅ Authentication Method Chosen

**Option A: Cloudflare Access (Recommended)**
- [ ] Cloudflare Access application created
- [ ] Application domain set to: `your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
- [ ] Application path set to: `/admin*`
- [ ] Access policy created with admin email addresses
- [ ] Authentication method chosen (Email OTP, Google, etc.)
- [ ] Config: `enableCloudflareAccess: true`

**Option B: Basic Email Validation**

- [ ] Config: `enableCloudflareAccess: false, enableAdminAuth: true`

**Option C: No Authentication (Development Only)**
- [ ] Config: `enableAdminAuth: false`
- [ ] ⚠️ **Warning acknowledged**: Admin panel will be publicly accessible

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### ✅ Local Testing
- [ ] Local development server started: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Contact form accessible at `http://localhost:8787`
- [ ] Form submission works (check console for database save)
- [ ] Admin panel accessible at `http://localhost:8787/admin`
- [ ] Status updates work in admin panel
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`

### ✅ Production Deployment
- [ ] Worker deployed: `npm run deploy`
- [ ] No deployment errors
- [ ] Production database schema applied: `wrangler d1 execute your-contact-db --file=schema.sql --remote`
- [ ] Worker URL accessible: `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

## 🧪 Post-Deployment Testing

### ✅ Contact Form Testing
- [ ] Contact form loads properly
- [ ] All form fields display correctly
- [ ] Form validation works (try submitting empty form)
- [ ] Form submission succeeds with valid data
- [ ] Success page displays after submission
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid data)

### ✅ Email Notification Testing

- [ ] Submissions display correctly
- [ ] Status updates work (dropdown changes)
- [ ] Statistics display correctly
- [ ] User information shows (if using Cloudflare Access)

### ✅ Security Testing
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Verify no production secrets committed to repository
  ```bash
  git log --oneline --grep="secret\|password\|key\|token" --all
  git log --oneline -S "account_id" --all
  git log --oneline -S "database_id" --all
  ```
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Confirm `wrangler.jsonc` and `.env` are gitignored
  ```bash
  git status --ignored | grep -E "(wrangler\.jsonc|\.env$)"
  ```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

**Contact form not working:**
```bash
wrangler tail --format=pretty
curl -X POST https://your-worker.workers.dev/submit -F "name=Test" -F "message=Test"
```

**Database issues:**
```bash
wrangler d1 execute your-db --command="SELECT * FROM submissions;" --remote
wrangler d1 info your-db
```

**Email not sending:**
- Verify destination addresses in Cloudflare Email Routing
- Check FROM_EMAIL matches domain with Email Routing
- Check worker logs for email errors

**Admin panel access issues:**
- Verify Cloudflare Access configuration
- Check JWT token in browser developer tools
- Verify admin email in allowedAdminEmails list
